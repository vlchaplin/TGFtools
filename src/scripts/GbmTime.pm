         GbmTime: Another package of time-related utility functions.
              (This complements DOY.pm)
              A portion of the GBM ground software:
              Written, Nov 25, 2009, by WHC @ USRA.

              V0.1: 11/25/09 WHC Added met_leapsecs, met2mjd, met2tjd,
                             met2tt, and met2utc
              V0.2: 11/30/09 WHC added isLeapsec, met2utcString met2ttString and 
                             modified met2utc to return the leap second as mm:60. 
              V0.3: 12/11/09 WHC added convert_UTC which is compatible with
                             DOY::convert_UTC.
              V1.0: 12/18/09 WHC completed tests and released GbmTime as
                             version 1.0 
              V1.1: 05/03/10 RDP Fixed fraction of day formatting in met2bn($met)  
                             so that a fraction of 999.9 is not rounded to the four
                             digit string '1000', but rather truncated to '999'.
			  V1.1: 09/21/10 VLC Added utc2met() and _time2met().

Functions:
 $nleapsecs = met_leapsecs($met);
              Returns the number of leapsecs that occured between launch and the 
              given MET.

 ($mjd, $rem) = met2mjd($met);
              Returns the MJD and remaining secs of the day in UTC.

 ($tjd, $rem) = met2tjd($met);
              Returns the TJD and remaining secs of the day in UTC.
              
 ($sec,$min,$hour,$mday,$mon,$year,$wday,$yday) = met2tt($met)
              Returns the calendar time based in TT.
              note: The output is based on gmtime.
                    Therefore $mon = 0..11 and $year = number of years since 1900.

 ($sec,$min,$hour,$mday,$mon,$year,$wday,$yday) = met2utc($met)
              Returns the calendar time based in UTC.
              note: The output is based on gmtime.
                    Therefore $mon = 0..11 and $year = number of years since 1900.

  $string = met2utcString($met)
              Returns a string representing the time in UTC.
              
  $string = met2ttString($met)
              Returns a string representing the time in TT.
              
 (yymmdd, fff) = met2bn($met)
              Returns the burst number as a tuple compatible with use on GCN.
              
 $string = met2bnString($met)
              Returns the burst number as a string using the format "bnyymmddfff"
 
 ($sec,$min,$hour,$mday,$mon,$year,$yday) = convert_UTC($met)
              Returns the calendar time based in UTC.
              Compatible with output of DOY::convert_UTC()
              $sec = 00...59, $min = 00..59, $hour = 00..23,
              $mday = 1...31, $mon = 1...12, $year = 2001...9999, $yday = 001...366
			  
	#VLC:				
	$met = utc2met( $sec,$min,$hour,$mday,$mon,$year,$wday,$yday )
				Converts UTC time struct to MET, using the routines time2met() and
				met_leapsecs().
				
	$met = _time2met( $sec,$min,$hour,$mday,$mon,$year,$wday,$yday )
				Converts UTC time struct to unix time then shifts it to the GLAST epoch, Jan 1,2001.
				Returns an integer number of seconds. Uses timegm(), so $sec is truncated if it's non-integral.

	# The idea is to only have to add leap seconds to an array when they are announced.
	#
	# This functions solves two problems:

	#      to apply the correct number of leap seconds when converting older METs to UTC.
	#
	#   2. Handles boundary issues correctly. A burst that happened just prior to a leap second
	#      will most likely be uploaded to the trigger catalog (HiTL) just after the leap second.
